# Thesis

Notebooks for the 2 groups (non-retracted, retracted) can be found in the folder '2group', notebooks for the 3 groups (non-retracted, misconduct, error) can be found in the folder '3group'.

Within each of these folders, the notebooks for data acquisition and pre-processing can be found in the folder 'preprocessing', the notebooks for analysis (dummy, naive bayes, support vector machine and logistic regression classifiers) can be found under 'classifier'.

For the 3 groups, the classifiers are names according to the sampling methos (e.g., SVM class balanced meaning class weights set to balanced for training the SVM classifier).

For both groups, the notebooks for data acquisition and pre-processing are named also according to their order, e.g., the 4th step, in which data is pre-processed, is named STEP4_preprocessing1.
